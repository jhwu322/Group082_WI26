    "We hypothesize that Airbnb rental prices in San Diego are associated with several characteristics, including location, size, and available services or amenities. Listings located closer to scenic areas such as the coast or forests, or city centers, are expected to be associated with higher nightly prices. These locations typically offer greater convenience and a more desirable stay experience. In addition, larger listings and those offering more amenities or higher quality service, such as pet-friendly options, may be associated with higher prices due to higher maintenance costs.\n",
    "Our analysis plan begins with exploratory data analysis (EDA) to examine the distributions of rental prices and the above listing characteristics. We will use visualizations to explore how prices vary across different locations and feature categories, and then apply regression models to assess the associations between rental prices and these characteristics while controlling for other relevant variables. Throughout the analysis, we will clearly state assumptions and discuss potential limitations, such as unobserved factors and the observational nature of the data, to avoid overinterpreting the results."

    "## Ethics \n",
    "\n",
    "### A. Data Collection\n",
    " -  **A.1 Informed consent**: If there are human subjects, have they given informed consent, where subjects affirmatively opt-in and have a clear understanding of the data uses to which they consent?\n",
    "\n",
    "> Yes. Our project utilizes publicly available datasets (e.g., Inside Airbnb or OpenData portals). As the data is secondary and public, direct informed consent from individuals was handled by the original data collectors; however, we affirmatively opt to use this data only for academic, non-commercial research.\n",
    "\n",
    " -  **A.2 Collection bias**: Have we considered sources of bias that could be introduced during data collection and survey design and taken steps to mitigate those?\n",
    "> Yes. We recognize that Airbnb data for San Diego may exhibit collection bias. Specifically, listings are skewed toward high-tourism coastal areas (like La Jolla or Pacific Beach), which may not reflect the pricing dynamics of inland or residential neighborhoods. We will acknowledge that our data only represents \"active\" digital users and may exclude informal or long-term rental market trends.\n",
    " -  **A.3 Limit PII exposure**: Have we considered ways to minimize exposure of personally identifiable information (PII) for example through anonymization or not collecting information that isn't relevant for analysis?\n",
    "\n",
    "   \n",
    "> Yes. We will strip any Personally Identifiable Information (PII) such as host names, specific apartment numbers, or reviewer names. We will aggregate data where possible to ensure individuals cannot be re-identified through triangulation of location and price.\n",
    " -  **A.4 Downstream bias mitigation**: Have we considered ways to enable testing downstream results for biased outcomes (e.g., collecting data on protected group status like race or gender)?\n",
    "\n",
    "### B. Data Storage\n",
    " -  **B.1 Data security**: Do we have a plan to protect and secure data (e.g., encryption at rest and in transit, access controls on internal users and third parties, access logs, and up-to-date software)?\n",
    "\n",
    " -  **B.2 Right to be forgotten**: Do we have a mechanism through which an individual can request their personal information be removed?\n",
    "> \n",
    " -  **B.3 Data retention plan**: Is there a schedule or plan to delete the data after it is no longer needed?\n",
    "> Yes. All raw datasets containing semi-identifiable information will be deleted from local machines upon the conclusion of the Winter 2026 quarter. Only the final, anonymized analysis and aggregated results will be maintained in the GitHub repository.\n",
    "> \n",
    "### C. Analysis\n",
    " -  **C.1 Missing perspectives**: Have we sought to address blindspots in the analysis through engagement with relevant stakeholders (e.g., checking assumptions and discussing implications with affected communities and subject matter experts)?\n",
    " -  **C.2 Dataset bias**: Have we examined the data for possible sources of bias and taken steps to mitigate or address these biases (e.g., stereotype perpetuation, confirmation bias, imbalanced classes, or omitted confounding variables)?\n",
    "> Yes. We acknowledge potential demographic bias. Beyond just \"tech-savvy users,\" we will investigate if the data disproportionately represents higher-income areas. To avoid the over-interpretation identified in our review of previous projects, we will explicitly state that our pricing model is a reflection of platform-specific trends, not a comprehensive valuation of San Diego real estate.\n",
    " -  **C.3 Honest representation**: Are our visualizations, summary statistics, and reports designed to honestly represent the underlying data?\n",
    " -  **C.4 Privacy in analysis**: Have we ensured that data with PII are not used or displayed unless necessary for the analysis?\n",
    " -  **C.5 Auditability**: Is the process of generating the analysis well documented and reproducible if we discover issues in the future?\n",
    "\n",
    "### D. Modeling\n",
    " -  **D.1 Proxy discrimination**: Have we ensured that the model does not rely on variables or proxies for variables that are unfairly discriminatory?\n",
    " -  **D.2 Fairness across groups**: Have we tested model results for fairness with respect to different affected groups (e.g., tested for disparate error rates)?\n",
    " -  **D.3 Metric selection**: Have we considered the effects of optimizing for our defined metrics and considered additional metrics?\n",
    " -  **D.4 Explainability**: Can we explain in understandable terms a decision the model made in cases where a justification is needed?\n",
    " -  **D.5 Communicate limitations**: Have we communicated the shortcomings, limitations, and biases of the model to relevant stakeholders in ways that can be generally understood?\n",
    "> Yes. We will include a \"Limitations and Assumptions\" section. This will detail the constraints of our model (e.g., inability to account for off-platform negotiations or seasonal events like Comic-Con that temporarily spike prices). This ensures stakeholders understand the context and prevents misuse of our predictive results.\n",
    "\n",
    "### E. Deployment\n",
    " -  **E.1 Monitoring and evaluation**: Do we have a clear plan to monitor the model and its impacts after it is deployed (e.g., performance monitoring, regular audit of sample predictions, human review of high-stakes decisions, reviewing downstream impacts of errors or low-confidence decisions, testing for concept drift)?\n",
    " -  **E.2 Redress**: Have we discussed with our organization a plan for response if users are harmed by the results (e.g., how does the data science team evaluate these cases and update analysis and models to prevent future harm)?\n",
    " -  **E.3 Roll back**: Is there a way to turn off or roll back the model in production if necessary?\n",
    " -  **E.4 Unintended use**: Have we taken steps to identify and prevent unintended uses and abuse of the model and do we have a plan to monitor these once the model is deployed?\n",
    " -  Ethical Narrative: > Our project prioritizes Data Privacy and Transparency. While our San Diego Airbnb dataset is publicly sourced, we acknowledge that hosts may not have explicitly consented to their information being used for predictive modeling. To mitigate potential harm, we will ensure that no exact geo-coordinates (latitude/longitude) are displayed in high-resolution visualizations to prevent the identification of specific private residences.\n",
    "\n",
    "Furthermore, we are committed to addressing Proxy Discrimination. In San Diego, variables such as \"Zip Code\" or \"Neighborhood\" are often highly correlated with race and socioeconomic status. We will audit our pricing model to ensure it does not inadvertently reinforce historical housing discrimination or \"redlining\" effects by over-penalizing certain neighborhoods. Finally, learning from previous work, we will explicitly document our model's limitations to prevent over-interpretation of the findings, ensuring our conclusions are used responsibly within the scope of academic research."

    "* Communication: Our primary mode of communication will be via WeChat for daily updates and Zoom/In-person for weekly syncs every Wednesday. We expect all members to respond to messages within 24 hours. For urgent matters, we will use phone calls or specific @ mentions.\n",
    "* Tone & Culture: We agree to a \"blunt but polite\" feedback loop. To ensure a constructive environment, we will use \"I\" statements (e.g., \"I am concerned this analysis might miss X\") to focus on the project rather than individuals. We will actively ensure that every member has a chance to speak during meetings.\n",
    "* Decision Making: Major project decisions, such as changing the research question or final model selection, will be decided by a majority vote. For smaller, specialized tasks, authority is delegated to the respective section leads. If a quick decision is needed and a member is non-responsive, the active majority will proceed.\n",
    "* Task Assignment & Accountability: Tasks will be assigned based on individual strengths and tracked using GitHub Issues. We aim for an equal distribution of effort across wrangling, analysis, and writing. If a member is struggling with a deadline, they must notify the group at least 48 hours in advance so we can re-allocate resources.\n",
    "* Conflict Resolution: Should a conflict arise, the team will first hold a private \"neutral ground\" discussion to understand different perspectives. We agree to assume positive intent. If a teammate consistently fails to meet agreed-upon expectations, we will provide written notice via email and, if no improvement is seen within one week, we will contact the instructor as per course policy.\n"
