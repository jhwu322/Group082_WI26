    "What listing characteristics are associated with nightly prices of Airbnb rentals in San Diego? \n",
    "- Using publicly available Airbnb listing data, we examine how capacity (accommodates/bedrooms/bathrooms), property type/room type, neighborhood or zip code, review ratings, minimum nights, and availability relate to nightly price. We estimate these associations using multiple regression (e.g., log(price)) while controlling for host experience (host listings count/superhot status), amenity indicators (Wi-Fi, parking, pool, kitchen, AC), booking policies (instant book, cancellation policy), and time-related factors (month/season) when available.\n",

    "Airbnb has become a major platform in the short-term rental market and plays an important role in tourism and local housing economies. Nightly pricing is a key factor that affects both hosts and guests, as it influences host revenue and guest booking decisions. However, Airbnb prices are not set randomly and are often related to various listing characteristics.\n",
    "\n",
    "Prior research has examined determinants of Airbnb pricing using publicly available listing data. For example, Wang and Nicolau (2017) found that location, property type, and review ratings significantly influence nightly prices. Similarly, Gunter (2018) showed that listings offering entire homes, larger accommodation capacity, and higher guest ratings tend to command higher prices. These studies suggest that observable characteristics such as neighborhood, property size, availability, and user-generated reviews are important predictors of rental pricing. While prior studies have examined European or multi-country markets, fewer studies focus specifically on San Diego, which motivates our city-level analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "Building on this prior work, our project focuses on modeling Airbnb rental prices in San Diego. Specifically, we examine how listing characteristics such as location (e.g., zip code), property type (entire home vs. private room), accommodation capacity, availability, and guest review ratings jointly relate to nightly prices. We apply exploratory data analysis and regression-based modeling to estimate the relative importance of these features.\n",
    "\n",
    "At the same time, we acknowledge that our dataset is observational and may omit unobserved factors, such as host experience, interior design quality, off-platform negotiations, or seasonal events (e.g., conventions or tourism peaks) that could also affect pricing. Therefore, our results should be interpreted as associations rather than causal effects. Our city-level analysis allows us to examine pricing patterns within a single metropolitan area while contributing to the broader literature on short-term rental pricing.\n",

    "\n",
    "To explore the relationship between listing features and Airbnb nightly prices in San Diego, we use two complementary datasets:\n",
    "\n",
    "Listing-level Airbnb data for San Diego\n",
    "\n",
    "Zip-code–level demographic data from the U.S. Census\n",
    "\n",
    "These datasets enable us to model Airbnb prices based on property-specific features, such as size, type, and amenities, as well as neighborhood factors like median income, population density, and proximity to attractions.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Dataset #1\n",
    "  - Dataset Name: Airbnb Open Data (San Diego)\n",
    "  - Link to the dataset: [Kaggle – Ariana Zmoudeh](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/arianazmoudeh/airbnbopendata)\n",
    "  - Number of observations: 102,599 rows (listings in the version of the dataset available on Kaggle)\n",
    "  - Number of variables: 26 columns of listing attributes\n",
    "  - Description of relevant variables:\n",
    "      - price – nightly listing price (often stored as text to convert to numeric)\n",
    "      - room_type – type of space offered (e.g., entire home, private room)\n",
    "      - minimum_nights – minimum required nights per booking\n",
    "      - availability_365 – number of days available in a year\n",
    "      - review_rate_number or similar – numeric review score\n",
    "      - neighbourhood – local area identifier\n",
    "      - lat, long – geographic coordinates\n",
    "      - Host attributes (e.g., host_identity_verified)\n",
    "  - Shortcomings:\n",
    "      The dataset covers the entire nation but should be filtered to focus solely on San Diego listings. Certain fields, like price, might require cleaning—such as removing currency symbols—before conducting numeric analysis. Not all listings contain every possible feature, such as detailed amenities. Additionally, the availability data might not account for seasonal fluctuations within each year.\n",

Normal values for healthy individuals range from 70 to 100 mg/dL.  Values 100-125 are prediabetic and values >125mg/dL indicate diabetes. Values <70 indicate hypoglycemia. Fasting idicates the patient hasn't eaten in the last 8 hours.  If blood glucose is >250 or <50 at any time (regardless of the time of last meal) the patient's life may be in immediate danger\"\n",
    "   2. If there are any major concerns with the dataset, describe them. For example \"Dataset is composed of people who are serious enough about eating healthy that they voluntarily downloaded an app dedicated to tracking their eating patterns. This sample is likely biased because of that self-selection. These people own smartphones and may be healthier and may have more disposable income than the average person.  Those who voluntarily log conscientiously and for long amounts of time are also likely even more interested in health than those who download the app and only log a bit before getting tired of it\"\n",
